# Cat Miner
> Ok, so for whoever doesn't know, cat miner started as just a sort of idle game that I made, and it was just a font awesome cat and a pickaxe mining air.

After that, I updated it a little bit more, changed the UI, made the space bar give you more money than you make idly, and added upgrades.

Now, it just looks the same pretty much but after that, there's a lot of updates coming in, so look out for new features!
