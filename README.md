# IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!!!
## Slowed development(like really slow)
> I am taking a break from all cat miner development, and no more updates will happen for a while.
## WHY?!?! WHY TALL KYLE WHY??
> The reasoning is that.. I am not really happy with how cat miner's code is right now, and it is hard to add new features sometimes.
> I want to take this time to get better at coding, and possibly rewrite all of the code. I still will keep the same logic, but I am not going to update for a while. 
# 0.3.1 RELEASED!
## Changes:
> - Changed the source images of all the pickaxes
> - Added Jonathan mode, and the Steel Pickaxe, and the Pickaxe pickaxe.
> - changed non-unlocked pickaxes to be displayed, but not shown what the pickaxe is.
# Cat Miner
Ok, so for whoever doesn't know, cat miner started as just a sort of idle game that I made, and it was just a font awesome cat and a pickaxe mining air.

After that, I updated it a little bit more, changed the UI,
made the space bar give you more money than you make idly, and added upgrades.

Now, it just looks the same, with minor changes, and bug fixes. But look out for new features, because they're coming!
